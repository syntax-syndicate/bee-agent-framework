The BeeAI framework core and its parts can be easily extended via the underlying concept of events and run contexts.

## Modules

The following section describes essential modules that are important to understand the whole concept.

### Event

An event refers to an action created by some component.

- Has a name (e.g., `start`, `success`, `error`, ..., `fetch_data`).
- Has a data payload (typically a Pydantic model).
- Has associated metadata about the context where the event was fired.

The emitted event is processed via callbacks that look like this:

```python
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModelStartEvent
from beeai_framework.emitter import EventMeta

async def handler(data: ChatModelStartEvent, meta: EventMeta) -> None:
  print(f"Received event {meta.name} ({meta.path}) at {meta.created_at}")
  print("-> created by", type(meta.creator))
  print("-> data payload", meta.model_dump())
  print("-> context", meta.context)
  print("-> trace", meta.trace)
```

### Emitter

The core component through which events are emitted and observed. An emitter is typically attached to some class but can be used alone.
An emitter instance is typically the child of a root emitter to which all events are propagated. Emitters can be nested (one can be a child of another), hence they internally create a tree hierarchy.

The emitter instance has the following **properties**:

- `namespace` in which the emitter operates (eg: `agents.requirement`, `tool.open_meteo`, ...).
- `creator` class which the given emitter belongs to.
- `context` (dictionary which is attached to all events emitted via the given emitter).
- `trace` metadata (such as current `id`, `run_id` and `parent_id`)

The emitter instance and the following **methods**:

- `on` for registering a new event listener
  - The method takes `matcher` (event name, callback, regex), `callback` (sync/async function), and `options` (priority, etc.)
  - The method can be used as a decorator or as a standalone function
- `off` for deregistering an event listener
- `pipe` for propagating all captured events to another emitter
- `child` for creating a child emitter

<Note>The event's `path` attribute is created by concatenating `namespace` with an event name (eg: `backend.chat.ollama.start`).</Note>

**Example**

The following example depicts a minimal application that does the following:

1. defines a data object for the `fetch_data` event,
2. creates an emitter from the root one,
3. registers a callback listening to the `fetch_data` event, which modifies its content,
4. fires the `fetch_data` event,
5. logs the modified event's data.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from beeai_framework.emitter import EventMeta, Emitter

# Define a data model for the event
class FetchDataEvent(BaseModel):
      url: str

# Create an emitter and pass events
emitter = Emitter.root().child(
    namespace=["app"],
    events={"fetch_data": FetchDataEvent} # optional
)

# Listen to an event
@emitter.on("fetch_data")
def handle_event(data: FetchDataEvent, meta: EventMeta) -> None:
    print(f"Retrieved event {meta}")
    data.url = "https://mywebsite.com"

# Create and emit the event
data = FetchDataEvent(url="https://example.com")
await emitter.emit("fetch_data", data)
print(data.url) # "https://mywebsite.com"

# Deregister a callback (optional)
emitter.off(callback=handle_event)
```

<Note>The `emitter.on` can be used directly and not just as a decorator. Example: `emitter.on("fetch_data", callback)`.</Note>

<Tip>If you name your function as either `handle_{event_name}` or `on_{event_name}`, then you don't need to provide the event name as a parameter, as it gets inferred automatically.</Tip>

### Run (Context)

The `Run` class **acts as a wrapper of the target implementation** with its **own lifecycle** (an emitter with a set of events) and **context** (data that gets propagated to all events).

The `RunContext` class is a container that contains information about the current execution context.

**Why is it useful?**

Such abstraction allows you to:

- modify `input` to the given target (listen to a `start` event and modify the content of the `input` property)
- modify `output` from the given target (listen to a `success` event and modify the content of the `output` property)
- does premature stop (listen to a `start` event and set the `output` property to  not a `None` value)
- propagate `context` (dictionary) to whatever component of your system you'd like
- cancel the execution in an arbitrary place
- observability

**The Run and Run Context gets created** when a `run` method gets called on a framework class that can be executed (eg, `ChatModel`, `Agent`, ...).

The run object has the following **methods**:

- The `on` method allows registering a callback to its emitter.
- The `middleware` for registering middleware (a function that takes `RunContext` as a first parameter or a class with a `bind` method that takes the `RunContext` as a first parameter).
- The `context` allows data to be set for a given execution. That data will then be propagated as metadata in every event that gets emitted.

The target implementation (handler) becomes part of the shared context (`RunContext`), which internally forms a hierarchical tree structure that shares the same context.


In simpler terms, when you call one runnable (e.g., `ChatModel`) from within another runnable (e.g., `Agent`), the inner call (`ChatModel`) is attached to the context of the outer one (`Agent`).

<Tip>The current execution context can be retrieved anytime by calling `RunContext.get()`.</Tip>


### Runnable

The `Runnable[R]` class was created to unify common objects that can be executed and observed. It is an abstract class with the following traits:

- It has an abstract `run` method that executes the class and returns a `Run[R]` (`R` is bound to the `RunnableOutput`).
- It has an abstract `emitter` getter.
- It has a `middlewares` getter that lists the existing middlewares.

**Invoking a Runnable**

Every runnable takes a list of messages as its first (positional) parameter, followed by the following optional keyword arguments (`RunnableOptions`):

- `signal` (an instance of `AbortSignal`) — allows aborting the execution.
- `context` (a dictionary) — used to propagate additional data.

You can also pass extra arguments that may or may not be processed by the given handler.

The `RunnableOutput` has the following properties:

- `output`: a list of messages (can be empty)
- `context`: a dictionary that can store additional data
- `last_message` (getter): returns the last message if it exists, or creates an empty `AssistantMessage` otherwise

**Creating a custom Runnable**

{/* <!-- embedme python/examples/simple_runnable.py --> */}
```py Python [expandable]
import asyncio
from functools import cached_property
from typing import Unpack

from beeai_framework.backend import AnyMessage, AssistantMessage, UserMessage
from beeai_framework.context import RunContext
from beeai_framework.emitter import Emitter
from beeai_framework.runnable import Runnable, RunnableOptions, RunnableOutput, runnable_entry


class GreetingRunnable(Runnable[RunnableOutput]):
    @runnable_entry
    async def run(self, input: list[AnyMessage], /, **kwargs: Unpack[RunnableOptions]) -> RunnableOutput:
        # retrieves the current run contex
        run = RunContext.get()

        response = f"Hello, {run.context.get('name', 'stranger')}!"

        # sends an emit so that someone can react to it (optional)
        await run.emitter.emit("before_send", response)

        return RunnableOutput(output=[AssistantMessage(response)])

    @cached_property
    def emitter(self) -> Emitter:
        return Emitter.root().child(namespace=["echo"])


async def main() -> None:
    echo = GreetingRunnable()
    response = await echo.run([UserMessage("Hello!")]).context({"name": "Alex"})
    print(response.last_message.text)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

## Working with events

The following sections show you how to use the emitter to capture and modify events.

### Scopes

Events can be generally observed on three different levels.

**1. Global Level**

Every emitter provided by the out-of-the-box modules is a child of the root emitter, which means we can listen to all events directly from the root emitter.

```python
from beeai_framework.emitter import Emitter, EventMeta
from typing import Any

def log_all_events(data: Any, meta: EventMeta):
  print(f"Received event ({meta.id}) with name {meta.name} and path {meta.path}. \
        The event was created by {type(meta.creator)} and is a type of {type(data)}.")

root = Emitter.root()
root.on("*.*", log_all_events)
```

<Note>Listeners that are bound "closer" to the source are executed earlier. For those that reside at the same level, the order can be altered by setting a `priority` value which is part of the `EmitterOptions` class.</Note>

**2. Instance Level**

On the other hand, we can listen to events emitted by a specific instance of a class.

```python
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModel, ChatModelStartEvent
from beeai_framework.backend.message import UserMessage
from beeai_framework.emitter import EventMeta
from typing import Any

def change_model_temperature(data: ChatModelStartEvent, meta: EventMeta):
    print(f"The chat model triggered a start event. Changing a temperature.")
    data.input.temperature = 0.5

model = ChatModel.from_name("ollama:granite3.3")
model.emitter.on("start", change_model_temperature)

await model.run([UserMessage("Hello!")])
```

The following example registers a callback to the class's emitter.
Therefore, all events in a given class will be captured.

**3. Run (Invocation) Level**

Sometimes we might want to listen to events emitted by a single run of a class.

```python
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModel, ChatModelStartEvent
from beeai_framework.backend.message import UserMessage
from beeai_framework.emitter import EventMeta
from typing import Any

model = ChatModel.from_name("ollama:granite4")

def change_model_temperature(data: ChatModelStartEvent, meta: EventMeta):
    print(f"The chat model triggered a start event. Changing a temperature.")
    data.input.temperature = 0.5

await model.run([UserMessage("Hello!")])
            .on("start", change_model_temperature)
```

In this example, we registered a callback, not the class itself, but to the concrete run instance (created by the `run` method).
The run instance has its own emitter, which is a direct child of the class emitter.
Thanks to this, one can apply modifications to a single run instead of the whole class.

### Config

With a larger number of callbacks, we might want to ensure that some run before the others or that some run exclusively.
To address these needs, we can use the optional keyword argument called `options` of type `EmitterOptions`.

**Example**

```python
from beeai_framework.emitter import EmitterOptions, EventMeta
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModel, ChatModelNewTokenEvent

# Creates a chat model instance
model = ChatModel.from_name("ollama:granite3.3", stream=True)

# Defines a callback that will be executed when a new token is emitted by the model
def cb(data: ChatModelNewTokenEvent, meta: EventMeta):
    print(f"[{meta.id}]: Received chunk", data.value.get_text_content())

# Creates a reference to the emitter
e = model.emitter

 # will be executed only once and then gets unregistered (default is False)
e.on("new_token", cb, EmitterOptions(once=True))

 # will not be deleted (default is False)
e.on("new_token", cb, EmitterOptions(persistent=True))

 # will be executed before those with a lower priority (default is 0), priority can also be negative
e.on("new_token", cb, EmitterOptions(priority=1))

# runs before every other callback with the same priority (default is False)
e.on("new_token", cb, EmitterOptions(is_blocking=True))

# match events that are emitted by the same type of class but executed within a target (e.g., calling agent.run(...) inside another agent.run(...))
e.on("new_token", cb, EmitterOptions(match_nested=True))
```

**Nested events**

Based on the value of the `matcher` parameter (the one that is used to match the event), the framework
decides whether to include/exclude nested events (events created from children emitters or from piping).

The default value of the `match_nested` depends on the `matcher` value. Note that the value can be set directly as shown in the example above.

| Matcher Type                       | Default `match_nested` |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| String without `.` (event name)    | `False`                |
| String with `.` (event path)       | `True`                 |
| `"*"` (match all top-level events) | `False`                |
| `"*.*"` (match all events)         | `True`                 |
| Regex                              | `True`                 |
| Function                           | `False`                |

<Note>If two events have the same priority, they are executed in the order they were added.</Note>


### Lifecycle

When a framework component is executed, it creates a run context, which is a wrapper around the target handler that gives us the ability to modify its input and output ([learn more](#run-context)).

**How it works?**

Once a `Run` instance is executed (i.e., **awaited**), the lifecycle begins:

1. The `start` event is emitted.
2. The target implementation is executed.
3. Depending on the outcome, either a `success` or `error` event is emitted.
4. Finally, the `finish` event is emitted.

The appropriate events are depicted in the following table:

| Event     | Data Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------- |:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`   | `RunContextStartEvent`   | Triggered when the run starts. |
| `success` | `RunContextSuccessEvent` | Triggered when the run succeeds. |
| `error`   | `FrameworkError`         | Triggered when an error occurs. |
| `finish`  | `RunContextFinishEvent`  | Triggered when the run finishes. |

See how you can listen to these events.

```python
import asyncio

from beeai_framework.backend import AnyMessage, AssistantMessage, ChatModelOutput
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModel, ChatModelNewTokenEvent
from beeai_framework.backend.message import UserMessage
from beeai_framework.context import RunContextStartEvent, RunContextFinishEvent, RunContext
from beeai_framework.emitter import EventMeta
from beeai_framework.emitter.utils import create_internal_event_matcher

model = ChatModel.from_name("ollama:granite3.3")

def change_temperature(data: RunContextStartEvent, meta: EventMeta) -> None:
    """Modify the input of the model.run()"""

    print("debug: changing temperature to 0.5.\n")
    data.input["temperature"] = 0.5 # data.input contains all positional/keyword arguments of the called function


def premature_stop(data: RunContextStartEvent, meta: EventMeta) -> None:
    """Checks whether the input contains malicious text.
    If so, we prevent the ChatModel from executing and immediately return a custom response.
    """

    print("debug: Checking for a malicious input")
    messages: list[AnyMessage] = data.input["input"]  # first parameter
    for message in messages:
        if "bomb" in message.text:
            print("debug: Premature stop detected.")
            data.output = ChatModelOutput(output=[AssistantMessage("Cannot answer that.")])
            break

def validate_new_token(data: ChatModelNewTokenEvent, meta: EventMeta) -> None:
    """Check if the stream contains a malicious word. If so, we abort the run."""

    run = RunContext.get()

    if "fuse" in data.value.get_text_content():
        print(f"Aborting run for user with ID {run.context.get('user_id')}")
        run._controller.abort("Policy violation. Aborting the run.")



response = await (
    model.run([UserMessage("How to make a bomb?")])
    .on("new_token", validate_new_token)
    .on(create_internal_event_matcher("start", model), change_temperature)
    .on(create_internal_event_matcher("start", model), premature_stop)
    .context({"user_id": 123})
)
print("Agent:", response.get_text_content())
```

<Note>In this example we are using `create_internal_event_matcher` which correctly matches the correct event.</Note>

<Tip>The current context can be retrieved anytime by calling `RunContext.get()` within a callback.</Tip>

### Debugging

To see which events get emitted in your case, the best way is to register a log-all callback for your run.

```python
agent = RequirementAgent("ollama:granite3:3", tools=[OpenMeteoTool()])
response = await agent
  .run("What's the current weather in Miami?")
  .on("*.*", lambda data, meta: print(meta.path, 'by', type(meta.creator)))
```


### Reusability

We just showed you how you can alter the component's behavior by listening to events that the target emits and modifying them. To make this concept more general and reusable, we can group all relevant listeners into a class called middleware.

Similarly, callbacks are registered via the `on` method, and middlewares are registered via the `middleware` method. Sometimes they can also be set on the class itself via a constructor.
The middleware is a function that takes the `RunContext` where one can attach desired callbacks. Middleware can also be a class with a public `bind` method that retrieves the `RunContext`.

{/* <!-- embedme python/examples/middleware/override.py --> */}

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from beeai_framework.backend import AssistantMessage, ChatModel, ChatModelOutput, UserMessage
from beeai_framework.context import RunContext, RunContextStartEvent, RunMiddlewareProtocol
from beeai_framework.emitter import EmitterOptions, EventMeta
from beeai_framework.emitter.utils import create_internal_event_matcher


class OverrideResponseMiddleware(RunMiddlewareProtocol):
    """Middleware that sets the result value for a given runnable without executing it"""

    def __init__(self, result: Any) -> None:
        self._result = result

    def bind(self, ctx: RunContext) -> None:
        """Calls once the target is about to be run."""

        ctx.emitter.on(
            create_internal_event_matcher("start", ctx.instance),
            self._run,
            # ensures that this callback will be the first invoked
            EmitterOptions(is_blocking=True, priority=1),
        )

    async def _run(self, data: RunContextStartEvent, meta: EventMeta) -> None:
        """Set output property to the result which prevents an execution of the target handler."""

        data.output = self._result


async def main() -> None:
    middleware = OverrideResponseMiddleware(ChatModelOutput(output=[AssistantMessage("BeeAI is the best!")]))
    response = await ChatModel.from_name("ollama:granite4:micro").run([UserMessage("Hello!")]).middleware(middleware)
    print(response.get_text_content())  # "BeeAI is the best!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

<Note>Note that this concept is built on top of the run instance and is not available on the standalone emitter.</Note>

<Important>Such middleware can be applied to an arbitrary class, just ensure that the mocked response matches the expected output type (eg, if you override the response for a `ChatModel`, then the return type should be of `ChatModelOutput`). The middleware can be both stateful and stateless, depending on the use case.</Important>

**When to use middleware vs simple callback registration?**

A rule of thumb is to create middleware if the desired functionality consists of multiple pieces that must be used together or when the functionality is more complex.


### Piping

In some cases, one might want to propagate all events from one emitter to another (for instance when creating a child emitter).

<CodeGroup>

{/* <!-- embedme python/examples/emitter/piping.py --> */}
```py Python [expandable]
import asyncio
import sys
import traceback

from beeai_framework.emitter import Emitter
from beeai_framework.errors import FrameworkError


async def main() -> None:
    first: Emitter = Emitter(namespace=["app"])

    first.on(
        "*.*",
        lambda data, event: print(
            f"'first' has retrieved the following event '{event.path}', isDirect: {event.source == first}"
        ),
    )

    second: Emitter = Emitter(namespace=["app", "llm"])

    second.on(
        "*.*",
        lambda data, event: print(
            f"'second' has retrieved the following event '{event.path}', isDirect: {event.source == second}"
        ),
    )

    # Propagate all events from the 'second' emitter to the 'first' emitter
    unpipe = second.pipe(first)

    await first.emit("a", {})
    await second.emit("b", {})

    print("Unpipe")
    unpipe()

    await first.emit("c", {})
    await second.emit("d", {})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except FrameworkError as e:
        traceback.print_exc()
        sys.exit(e.explain())

```

{/* <!-- embedme typescript/examples/emitter/piping.ts --> */}
```ts TypeScript [expandable]
import { Emitter, EventMeta } from "beeai-framework/emitter/emitter";

const first = new Emitter({
  namespace: ["app"],
});

first.match("*.*", (data: unknown, event: EventMeta) => {
  console.log(
    `'first' has retrieved the following event ${event.path}, isDirect: ${event.source === first}`,
  );
});

const second = new Emitter({
  namespace: ["app", "llm"],
});
second.match("*.*", (data: unknown, event: EventMeta) => {
  console.log(
    `'second' has retrieved the following event '${event.path}', isDirect: ${event.source === second}`,
  );
});

// Propagate all events from the 'second' emitter to the 'first' emitter
const unpipe = second.pipe(first);

await first.emit("a", {});
await second.emit("b", {});

console.log("Unpipe");
unpipe();

await first.emit("c", {});
await second.emit("d", {});

```

</CodeGroup>

## Existing middlewares

The following section showcases built-in middlewares that you can start using right away.

### Global Trajectory

The fastest way to see what's happening in your code (who is calling what) is by using the `GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware`. It captures all events (even deeply nested) and prints them to the console while visualizing nested calls with indentation.

**Example**

```python
from beeai_framework.middleware.trajectory import GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware

agent = RequirementAgent(
    llm="ollama:granite3:3",
    tools=[OpenMeteoTool()]
)
await agent.run("What's the current weather in Miami?")
            .middleware(GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware())
```

See which parameters can be passed to the constructor.

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target`           | Specify a file or stream to which to write the trajectory (pass `False` to disable).                     |
| `included`         | List of classes to include in the trajectory.                                                            |
| `excluded`         | List of classes to exclude from the trajectory.                                                          |
| `pretty`           | Use pretty formatting for the trajectory.                                                                |
| `prefix_by_type`   | Customize how instances of individual classes should be printed.                                         |
| `exclude_none`     | Exclude `None` values from the printing.                                                                 |
| `enabled`          | Enable/Disable the logging.                                                                              |
| `match_nested`     | Whether to observe trajectories of nested run contexts.                                                  |
| `emitter_priority` | Setting higher priority may result in capturing events without any modifications from other middlewares. |

**Example**

```python
from beeai_framework.middleware.trajectory import GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware
from beeai_framework.tools.tool import Tool
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModel
from beeai_framework.tools.weather.openmeteo import OpenMeteoTool
from beeai_framework.agents.base import BaseAgent

GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware(target=[Tool]) # log only tool calls
GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware(target=[Tool], excluded=[OpenMeteoTool]) # log only tool calls except OpenMeteoTool
GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware(target=[ChatModel]) # log only tool calls except OpenMeteoTool
GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware(prefix_by_type={BaseAgent: "🐝 "}) # use Bee Emoji for agents
```

<Tip>You can listen to events emitted throughout the execution and build your custom trajectory.</Tip>


### Tool Call Streaming

Middleware for handling streaming tool calls in a ChatModel. This middleware observes and listens to [Chat Model](/modules/backend#chat-model) stream updates and parses the tool calls on demand so that they can be consumed as soon as possible.

The middleware works even **without streaming** enabled. It just emits the `update` event at the very end.

**Example**

{/* <!-- embedme python/examples/middleware/llm_streaming.py --> */}
```py Python
import asyncio

from beeai_framework.backend import ChatModel, UserMessage
from beeai_framework.emitter import EventMeta

### GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware

The following events are handled internally by the `GlobalTrajectoryMiddleware`:

| Event     | Data Type                                | Description                                                                                 |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`   | `GlobalTrajectoryMiddlewareStartEvent`   | Triggered when a target begins execution.                                                   |
| `success` | `GlobalTrajectoryMiddlewareSuccessEvent` | Triggered when a target completes successfully.                                             |
| `error`   | `GlobalTrajectoryMiddlewareErrorEvent`   | Triggered when an error occurs during target execution.                                     |
| `finish`  | `GlobalTrajectoryMiddlewareFinishEvent`  | Triggered after a target has finished execution, regardless of success or failure.          |

All events inherit from the `GlobalTrajectoryMiddlewareEvent` class.

```python
class GlobalTrajectoryMiddlewareEvent(BaseModel):
    message: str
    level: TraceLevel
    origin: tuple[Any, EventMeta]
```

The first element of the `origin` attribute is the original event (e.g., `start` → `RunContextStartEvent`, etc.) that comes from the `RunContext`.

### RunContext

Special events that are emitted before the target's handler gets executed.
A run event contains `.run.` in its event's path and has `internal` set to true in the event's context object.

| Event     | Data Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------- |:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`   | `RunContextStartEvent`   | Triggered when the run starts. Has `input` (positional/keyword argument with which the function was run) and `output` property. Set the `output` property to prevent the execution of the target handler. |
| `success` | `RunContextSuccessEvent` | Triggered when the run succeeds. |
| `error`   | `FrameworkError`         | Triggered when an error occurs. |
| `finish`  | `RunContextFinishEvent`  | Triggered when the run finishes. |
