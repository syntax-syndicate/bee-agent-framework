    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the BeeAI project is to make AI agents interoperable, regardless of their underlying implementation. The project consists of two key components:\n",
    "- **BeeAI Platform**: The platform to easily discover, run, and compose AI agents from any framework.\n",
    "- **BeeAI Framework**: A production-grade framework for building AI agents in either Python or TypeScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed information on BeeAI can be found [here](https://beeai.dev/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's in this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the BeeAI Requirement agent, a declarative AI agent that combines language models, tools, and execution requirements to create predictable, controlled behavior across different LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Requirement Agent?\n",
    "- Building agents that work reliably across multiple LLMs is difficult. Most agents are tightly tuned to specific models, with rigid prompts that cause models to misinterpret instructions, skip tools, or hallucinate facts.\n",
    "- RequirementAgent provides a declarative framework for designing agents that strikes a balance between flexibility and control. It allows for agent behavior that is both predictable and adaptable, without the complexity and limitations of more rigid systems.\n",
    "- The core concept behind the Requirement Agent is that everything is treated as a tool—including data retrieval, web search, reasoning, and generating final answers. This modular structure ensures valid responses with structured outputs and helps eliminate parsing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this notebook on [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/). The notebook uses **Ollama** to provide access to a variety of foundation models for remote execution. The notebook will run faster on Colab if you use the free *T4 GPU* option by selecting *Runtime / Change runtime type* in the Colab system menu."
